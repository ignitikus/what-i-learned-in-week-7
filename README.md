## [String Theory](https://github.com/ignitikus/string-theory/blob/master/main.js)
Learned to how to select and change every other letter in a string.<br>
Note: Use counter to skip unwanted symbols.  

## [Mapmaker-Mapmaker](https://github.com/ignitikus/mapmaker-mapmaker/blob/master/main.js)
Learned how to build new arrays. <br>
Note: Create empty array and push strings in it. Don't forget to `return`.

## [Methods to my Madness](https://github.com/ignitikus/methods-to-my-madness/blob/master/main.js)

    repeat(n) - strings only. Repeats string n times.
    startsWith() - strings only. Checks if a strings starts with certain number of characters. Returns boolean.
    endsWith() - opposite of starts with.
    includes(value) - used on both strings and arrays. Checks if a string or an arrays contains specific value. 
    join(separator) - arrays only. Concatenates all strings within array. Separator can be passed in to separate strings. Otherwise will be joined with commas.
    split(separator, limit) - strings only. Creates an array with string's value. Separator can be used to split a string into substrings in array. Limit - number of splits
    trimStart() - Removes whitespaces from the beginning of a string.
